Changes made by Kalif Purce.


**Editing Horiseon website to make it more presentable,more functional, and accessible for all ages and groups.**



Change Log:

1st Change:Noticed the title was incorrect or not as discriptive so i changed it to the proper name of the website listed.

2nd change:No alt tags listed for images, i followed suit giving the same name as the original listings on page to keep them 1-1

3rd change: Search engine optimization tag at the top wasnt linked like the other 2 to the correct part of their page so i corrected that.

4th change: ended up not keeping in the change to font family, i had shortened them to less forms listed but was pretty sure thats put in place for accessability of machine so i changed it back.

5th change: Changed the footer to be black so its visible, dont know if thats a problem only on my machine via old extentions from C++(ran into a problem with this earlier today coding)
